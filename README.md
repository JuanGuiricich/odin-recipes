Odin Recipes

This project is part of the Foundation Course of The Odin Project as a test to evaluate the HTML and Git conceps seen during the course.

The project has a main index.html and 3 more pages.

The idea is to create a recipes website with 3 recipes, each one with it's ingredients, filled on an unordered list, and the steps in an ordered list. It has also to include an image of the finished dish and add a description to the image using headings and paragraphs.
